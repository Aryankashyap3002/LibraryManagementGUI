Great to hear that it's working now! There are several ways you could enhance your Library Management System project. Here are some suggestions:

1. Graphical User Interface (GUI):


```cpp
#include <QApplication>
#include <QMainWindow>
#include <QPushButton>
#include <QVBoxLayout>

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    QApplication app(argc, argv);
    QMainWindow window;
    
    QWidget *centralWidget = new QWidget(&window);
    QVBoxLayout *layout = new QVBoxLayout(centralWidget);
    
    QPushButton *librarianButton = new QPushButton("Librarian", centralWidget);
    QPushButton *studentButton = new QPushButton("Student", centralWidget);
    QPushButton *facultyButton = new QPushButton("Faculty", centralWidget);
    
    layout->addWidget(librarianButton);
    layout->addWidget(studentButton);
    layout->addWidget(facultyButton);
    
    window.setCentralWidget(centralWidget);
    window.setWindowTitle("Library Management System");
    window.show();
    
    return app.exec();
}

```

This is a basic example using Qt. You'd need to install Qt and link it in your project to use this.

2. Database Integration:
   Replace CSV files with a relational database like SQLite or MySQL for better data management and querying capabilities.

3. Search Functionality:
   Implement advanced search features (e.g., by author, genre, publication year).

4. Reservation System:
   Allow users to reserve books that are currently checked out.

5. Fine System:
   Implement a system to calculate and track fines for overdue books.

6. Book Recommendations:
   Create a recommendation system based on user borrowing history.

7. User Profiles:
   Allow users to create and manage their profiles, including preferences and reading history.

8. Admin Dashboard:
   Create a dashboard for librarians to view statistics and manage the system.

9. Email Notifications:
   Send email reminders for due dates, reservations, etc.

10. Barcode Integration:
    Implement a barcode system for easy book check-out and check-in.

11. Unit Testing:
    Add comprehensive unit tests to ensure reliability as you add new features.

```cpp
#include <catch2/catch.hpp>
#include "Book.h"

TEST_CASE("Book creation and accessors", "[book]") {
    Book book("The Great Gatsby", "F. Scott Fitzgerald", 1925);
    
    REQUIRE(book.getTitle() == "The Great Gatsby");
    REQUIRE(book.getAuthor() == "F. Scott Fitzgerald");
    REQUIRE(book.getYear() == 1925);
    REQUIRE(book.isAvailable() == true);
}

```

This example uses the Catch2 testing framework. You'd need to install and link Catch2 in your project to use this.

12. Logging System:
    Implement a logging system to track all actions and errors for debugging and auditing purposes.

13. Multi-language Support:
    Add support for multiple languages to make your system accessible to a wider audience.

14. Data Visualization:
    Create graphs and charts to visualize library statistics (e.g., most borrowed books, active users).

15. API Development:
    Create a RESTful API to allow integration with other systems or development of a separate frontend.

Choose enhancements that align with your learning goals and the specific needs of your library system. Start with one or two features and gradually build up your system's capabilities.
